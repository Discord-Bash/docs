## settings.json missing

On every launch, the bot checks for the settings file, if the file cannot be found, it will be created and you'll be informed by the console. 

## Files/Directories missing

On every user login, the bot checks its filesystem for all files and directories needed to work properly, if some file or directory doesn't exist, the bot will create it automatically, so you don't need to do anything, just login to the system and let it do the work.
